# NRF24L01 Wireless RC Car Controller

This repository contains the code and schematics for a wireless RC car control system using NRF24L01 modules. The project utilizes an analog joystick for the transmitter (TX) to control an RC car equipped with two motor drivers and four DC motors on the receiver (RX).

## Features
- **Long-Range Wireless Control:** Supports communication over distances up to 200 meters.
- **Analog Joystick Control:** Allows precise control of the RC car's movement using an analog joystick.
- **Dual Motor Drivers:** Controls four DC motors for efficient car movement and maneuverability.
- **Microcontroller-Based:** Compatible with various microcontrollers like Arduino and ATmega.

## Components Used
- NRF24L01 Modules (1 for TX, 1 for RX)
- Analog Control Joystick
- Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino Uno, ATmega)
- 2 Motor Drivers (e.g., L298N)
- 4 DC Motors
- Basic electronic components (e.g., resistors, capacitors)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install the Arduino IDE or any compatible development environment.
- NRF24L01 library for Arduino (install from the Arduino Library Manager).

### Setup Instructions
